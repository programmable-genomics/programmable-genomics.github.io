            <h2>Research Areas</h2>
            <p><strong>The Programmable Genomics Laboratory</strong> focuses on several key areas where deep learning models and novel algorithms can lead to breakthroughs in synthetic biology. We develop new methods, scale up existing methods, and find novel application areas where designed regulatory elements can drive forward research.</p>

                    <h3>Regulatory Element Design</h3>
                    <p>We develop methods for designing regulatory elements with precise properties. Although this primarily focuses on using deep learning-based predictive models to design cell type-specific enhancers, we are looking to go further than that by also controlling precise transcriptional dosage in the on-target cell type and minimize the size of the regulatory element. To this end, we have developed software for simple design algorithms and Ledidi, a method for editing initial templates to achieve desired activities</p>

                    <h3>Compact Deep Learning Architectures</h3>
                    <p>In service of tackling challenging design tasks, we develop deep learning models that have fewer parameters and run faster than the current state-of-the-art without compromising on accuracy. This allows us to fit more models in GPU memory and use more models simultaneously, giving us much finer control over the properties we want to design for. </p>

                    <h3>Ecosystem Engineering</h3>
                    <p>Progress in genomic machine learning has been remarkable, but is still slower than it could be because most algorithms downstream from the predictive model are implemented in a bespoke manner, or tied to a research code-base that is not optimized for general usage. To accelerate our own progress, and progress in the field, we write software with a focus on usability and adaptability so that those without our computational expertise can still make important contributions.</p>
